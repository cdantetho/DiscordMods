**I'm currently in the process of updating Lighty's depracated VoiceChatMoveAll plugin.**

It was never updated to use the new contextmenu's, and Lighty has removed it from [his GitLab](https://_lighty_.gitlab.io/bdstuff/). **I've taken it upon myself to attempt to create a functioning version of this plugin again!**

**This simple theme was custom coded by Dante#3456.** If you need any assistance, feel free to DM me

**Enjoy! <3**
