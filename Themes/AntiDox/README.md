# AntiDox.theme.css

Blurs personal information on Discord. Will un-blur information when you hover over it, so beware.

This theme was developed by Dante#3456 with the goal of helping users NOT dox themselves whenever they open their settings window while screensharing.

I will be working to add more features to this as I see more potential to conceal personal information. If you need any assistance, feel free to DM me.

Enjoy!
