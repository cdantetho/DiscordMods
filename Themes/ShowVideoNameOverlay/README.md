**Always shows each user's name when viewing video call cameras, instead of having to mouse over the video to display the name. Does not work in video pop out.**

**Also changes the mic activity circle to a red color** (was using for testing but left it for personal preference). Find and replace "#BA3B46" with your own hex color to customize it!

**This simple theme was custom coded by Dante#3456** just to add simple features that I found helpful. If you need any assistance, feel free to DM me

**Enjoy! <3**
